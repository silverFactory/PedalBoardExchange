This app is designed to make buying and selling guitar effects pedals on Craigslist easier. 
The command line interface asks the user to search for a specific pedal,
finds relevant posts on Craigslist, then uses the information from those posts
to search Guitar Center's website to get the new price as well as the 
manufacturer's description.
